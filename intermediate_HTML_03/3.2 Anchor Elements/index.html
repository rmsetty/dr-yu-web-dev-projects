<h1>My top 5 Favourite Websites</h1>

Create an Ordered List:

Use the <ol> tag to create an ordered list of your top 5 favorite websites.
For each website, use the <li> tag to create a list item.
Inside each list item, add an anchor tag <a> with the href attribute linking to the website URL and the text as the website name.
Extra Challenge (Optional):

Modify the ordered list to start numbering from 5 instead of 1 by adding the start="5" attribute to the <ol> tag.
